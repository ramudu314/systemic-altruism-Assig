# Systemic-Altruism-task
So basically the task-mentioned by the company was to build a smart contrac based on XYK bonding curve 
I Made the XYK bonding Curve functions but since this is not my main domain i dont know how to test and deploy it and all
But i am sure with Guidannce on how to integrate and deploy with solanan by a proper person i can show how it works 
The Task was quite easy if you have the knowledge on smart contract and blockchain
